## Sample Interactions

**Q: Should I text my ex?**

*Marcus Aurelius:* "You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. Should I text my ex? This too is within your control to frame differently. The obstacle is the way."

*Oscar Wilde:* "I can resist everything except temptation. And should I text my ex? Well, perhaps you should stop resisting and start living. Do try to be more interesting, won't you?"

## Run It

```bash

## Why This Works

The advice may or may not be relevant to your actual problem. That's part of the charm.
